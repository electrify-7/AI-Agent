## Usage

### Starting the Server

Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on the default port (5000) unless configured otherwise.

### üìû Making Test Calls

1. Ensure your Twilio webhook URLs are properly configured to point to your deployed application
2. Use the Twilio console to initiate test calls or integrate with the API
3. Monitor call logs and conversation transcripts in the frontend dashboard

---

## üîå API Endpoints

The system exposes several API endpoints:


| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `/call/incoming` | POST | Handles incoming call webhooks from Twilio |
| `/call/status` | POST | Processes call status updates |
| `/transcribe` | POST | Converts speech to text for processing |
| `/generate-response` | POST | Creates AI responses based on conversation context |
| `/text-to-speech` | POST | Converts text responses to natural speech |

---

## Customization

### Agent Personality

Modify the agent's personality and conversation style by updating the prompt templates in the configuration files. The system supports different personas for various sales contexts.

### Product Information

Update the `COMPANY_PRODUCTS_SERVICES` environment variable with detailed product information to enable the agent to provide accurate recommendations and answers.

### Conversation Flows

The conversation logic can be customized by modifying the AI prompt templates and conversation handlers in the codebase.

## Security

This system handles sensitive customer information and requires proper security measures:

- All API keys should be kept secure in environment variables
- Implement proper authentication for API endpoints
- Ensure GDPR and other regulatory compliance for call recording and data storage
- Regularly rotate API keys and access credentials

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Voice quality issues**: Check Eleven Labs configuration and voice selection
2. **Slow response times**: Optimize OpenAI API calls and implement caching
3. **Call connection failures**: Verify Twilio credentials and webhook configurations
4. **Database connection errors**: Check MongoDB connection string and network access

### Frontend Dashboard

The project includes a basic frontend dashboard that allows you to:

- View ongoing and completed calls
- Access conversation transcripts
- Analyze call performance metrics
- Manage agent configurations

<p>Note: The frontend is currently a basic implementation. Database integration and advanced analytics features are planned for future development.</p>

## Future Development

- Complete MongoDB integration for data persistence
- Enhanced analytics dashboard with call performance metrics
- Multi-agent support for different product lines
- Integration with CRM systems for lead management
- Advanced conversation analytics and insights
